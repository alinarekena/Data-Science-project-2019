Original models were build using R, and we did the estimation of the change in model performance caused by using different programming language and libraries. Notebook PROJECT_Bioconcentration_factor_06_RF_models_FINALoob_coments_added contains replicated models from the original publication.

To get models, presented in the Results section, notebooks XGBoost_Validation, Old_Validation_SVM_Naive (contains both Linear SVM model and Gaussian Naive Bayes) and Old_Validation_LightGBM have to be run. The graphical representation was done by transferring numbers to Results_OLD_v3_xgboost notebook.

Final sets of parameters were chosen after running XGBoost_Train, Old_Train_SVM_Naive and Old_Train_LightGBM with different model parameters, manually or by loops. Linear SVM was chosen after trying Gaussian, Linear Polynomial and Sigmoid kernels (notebooks SVM - Gaussian Kernel, SVM - Linear, SVM - Polynomial Kernel and SVM - Sigmoid Kernel respectively). Other types of SVM were either not effective or took to much time to run.

All those models were run using 3 selected features from the paper. We as well performed our feature selection, which can be found in the Features selection notebook. The algorithm is based on random shuffling and splitting of the dataset, thus can give a slightly different result every time.
Notebooks marked with New used features selected by our algorithm as an input, but the performance was insufficient and they were not included in final results.
